  abstract = {The purpose is to arrive at recognition of multicolored objects invariant to a substantial change in viewpoint, object geometry and illumination. Assuming dichromatic reflectance and white illumination, it is shown that normalized color rgb, saturation S and hue H, and the newly proposed color models c1c2c3andl1l2l3 are all invariant to a change in viewing direction, object geometry and illumination. Further, it is shown that hue H and l1l2l3 are also invariant to highlights. Finally, a change in spectral power distribution of the illumination is considered to propose a new color constant color model m1m2m3. To evaluate the recognition accuracy differentiated for the various color models, experiments have been carried out on a database consisting of 500 images taken from 3-D multicolored man-made objects. The experimental results show that highest object recognition accuracy is achieved by l1l2l3 and hue H followed by c1c2c3, normalized color rgb and m1m2m3 under the constraint of white illumination. Also, it is demonstrated that recognition accuracy degrades substantially for all color features other than m1m2m3 with a change in illumination color. The recognition scheme and images are available within the PicToSeek and Pic2Seek systems on-line at: http: //www.wins.uva.nl/research/isis/zomax/.}

  abstract  = {Scene classification systems have become an integral part of computer vision. Recent developments have seen the use of deep scene networks based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), trained using millions of images to classify scenes into various categories. This paper proposes the use of one such pre-trained network to classify specific scene categories. The pre-trained network is combined with the simple classifiers namely, random forest and extra tree classifiers to classify scenes into 8 different scene categories. Also, the effect of different color spaces such as RGB, YCbCr, CIEL*a*b* and HSV on the performance of the proposed CNN based scene classification system is analyzed based on the classification accuracy. In addition to this, various intensity planes extracted from the said color spaces coupled with color-to-gray image conversion techniques such as weighted average, and singular value decomposition (SVD) are also taken into consideration and their effects on the performance of the proposed CNN based scene classification system are also analyzed based on the classification accuracy. The experiments are conducted on the standard Oliva Torralba (OT) scene data set which comprises of 8 classes. The analysis of classification accuracy obtained for the experiments conducted on OT scene data shows that the different color spaces and the intensity planes extracted from various color spaces and color-to-gray image conversion techniques do affect the performance of proposed CNN based scene classification system.},
